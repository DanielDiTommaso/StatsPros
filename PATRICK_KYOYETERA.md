#Overview

In this project, the main idea was to make statistical comparisons between two players easier. It was constructed from a passion for sports and Math and a desire to be able to make easy conclulsions to conversations about player contributions.
Te program itself makes use of simple representations of player statistics using bar graphs in a browser. A user chooses players from two teams and selects what stat to view and the program returns a bar graph with two bars, one per player.

 ##Libraries Used
 
 The entire program makes use of the following libraries 
 ```
(require net/url)
(require net/uri-codec)
(require net/url-connect)
(require net/http-client)
(require json)
(require racket/list)
(require racket/runtime-path)
(require web-server/servlet)
(requrie plot)
```
